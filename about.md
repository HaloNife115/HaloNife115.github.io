Hello! I am learning how to code through [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/), and I have been really enjoying my experience. I decided to create a website, and they gave me a tutorial on how to create one with jekyll, which can be found at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). Since I needed to find a topic for the website I was creating, I decided to make a website about my favorite sport, swimming. I have been swimming on a rec team since I was 7, and now that I am about to go off to college I am starting to worry slightly that I will be unable to continue in college. We shall see. I hope you join me in this amazing journey. It shall be glorious.
Peace, Love, and many Laps,
HaloNife115
